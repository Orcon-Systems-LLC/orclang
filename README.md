## Quickstart
So , to run a orclang program, just type 
```
./orclang.out <folder_name>/<filename>.orclg

```

**NOTE: FOLDER NAME IS REQUIRED . IT IS A LITTLE BUG . TO FIX IT, IT'LL TAKE A LONG TIME. AND INTERPRETER REBOOTS AFTER EVRY COMMAND, SO YOU CANNOT ADD A VARIABLE. ONLY SUPPORTED IN FILE**

Or to just start the interpreter, just use ``` ./orclang.out ```

To print something type ```print("<your text here>");```
to declare a function type ``` void yourname(YOUR_DATA){YOUR ACCTION}```
To declare a variable type ```var name = "value" ```
